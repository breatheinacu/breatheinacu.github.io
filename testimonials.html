			<quote>“I started getting acupuncture with Lexi at the age of 13 because I was really struggling with my weight.  I have been seeing her for almost 2 years and I can attest that Lexi is truly the best at what she does.  She is an extraordinary person who genuinely cares about her clients.  She constantly motivates me in our treatment sessions, in addition to giving me so amny practical tips and ideas to help me live optimally.  Since treatments began, I’ve lost over fifty pounds and words cannot describe how much better I feel about myself.  Also, I’ve adopted far healthier living habits and my stress, anxiety and irritability have significantly decreased.  Thank you Lexi for being both the practitioner and the person that you are.”</quote>

As a licensed physical therapist/massage therapist I have extensive knowledge on the time required to rehab this injury. To my surprise, after one visit with Lexi I had full range of motion restored. I've been trained in western science and I can say that I'm amazed at how quickly Lexi’s type of treatment works.  She puts you at ease immediately and the entire process is painless.”</quote>

			<quote>“Lexi is amazing at what she does.  From my very first session Lexi made me feel comfortable, safe and most importantly relaxed!  Two years later and after regular weekly treatments with her, I can honestly say she is a miracle worker.  I originally sought out Lexi to help me with some major anxiety issues.  Her treatments and approach helped me deal with my anxiety and very specific physical symptoms more than any other thing I had been trying for the last 10 years - and believe me, I have tried just about everything!  Lexi is so personable and easy to talk to, which is a huge benefit to getting the most out of a treatment.  She listens carefully to all of my details and works with me to target the right treatments that really make a noticeable difference.  She is very flexible and incredibly smart at determining the core of problems and how to solve them - so much so, that beyond my original anxiety concerns she helped me combat my lingering gestational diabetes, postpartum issues and later on overall well-being, stress, aches, pains and energy levels.  Her openness and expansive knowledge of all kinds of related acupuncture treatments is amazing, and I have tried many different types of treatments with her.  Lexi's knowledge is impressive, and I always leave my sessions learning something new to apply to my daily life that only helps me further.  Lexi's gentle approach, amazing attitude and all around extremely pleasant personality in addition to her amazing technical expertise make her the best at what she does.  She truly cares about her patients and takes the time to get to know them personally.  I have recommended her to many of my friends and they all agree how wonderful she is.  Lexi has helped me in so many ways and treats me like a true friend and someone that cares.”</quote>

			<quote>“Lexi was recommended by a friend when I was at due date with my first baby.  I had tried everything to naturally induce labor- I had eaten spicy food, walked miles, and done other things but nothing was getting my baby out.  At first I was scared, but Lexi earned my trust quickly with her calm but assured manner.  I had Lexi give me acupuncture every other day, at my home, and a couple of hours after my third session my labor started.  My labor was relatively quick and painless and I’m so happy I decided to get acupuncture from Lexi- she was absolutely great!”</quote>
