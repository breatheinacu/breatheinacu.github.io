			<h1>WELCOME</h1>
			<p>Inhale exhale repeat.  Breathing deeply and fully is the easiest way to dissolve tension and restore tranquility in the body.  Breathing deeply bathes the cells in oxygen and disperses stagnation in the body.  It refocuses the mind and has a calming effect on the nervous system.  We must take good care of ourselves to be in good health.</p>
