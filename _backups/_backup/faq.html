			<strong>How many treatments will I need?</strong>
			<p>Treatment plans vary from person to person depending on the nature and severity of the condition.  Acute conditions may only require one to two treatments, while more chronic conditions may require six to twelve.  In general, weekly sessions are recommended.  During each session the patient is reevaluated and the treatment plan is constantly updated.  Most patients discover that they enjoy the feeling during and after treatments, even when they are healthy.  Maintenance and prevention of disease are key elements of Chinese medicine.</p>
			<strong>Is acupuncture safe?</strong>
			<p>Acupuncture is completely safe!  Only the highest quality stainless steel needles are used.  All needles are single-use, so they are sterilized, individually wrapped and disposed of immediately after use.  Children, elderly and pregnant women can all safely receive acupuncture from licensed practitioners.</p>
			<strong>Do you take insurance?</strong>
			<p>This depends on whether or not your insurance policy covers acupuncture.  Please provide insurance information when scheduling your appointment and I will verify for you.  If it covers acupuncture I will gladly take insurance.</p>
			<strong>Do you handle <a href="http://insurance.freeadvice.com/information/auto/article/82">No-Fault</a> automobile accidents?</strong>
			<p>Anyone injured by an automobile- as the driver, passenger or a pedestrian- is automatically covered by No-Fault automobile insurance for recurrent medical attention (as long as you live in a No-Fault state such as New York).  I will absolutely treat these cases free of charge to the victim.</p>
			<strong>Are there any side effects?</strong>
			<p>Side effects are rare.  The most common side effect of acupuncture is slight bruising at the site of needle.  You may experience light-headedness or slight fatigue.  All of these shouldn’t last long and may be reported at your next visit.</p>
			<strong>How should I prepare for a treatment?</strong>
			<p>Be sure to eat a light meal a few hours before your treatment.  It’s best to wear loose fitting comfortable clothing that can be rolled up to your elbows or knees.  Gowns and towels are provided as needed.</p>
			<strong>What is cupping?</strong>
			<p>Cupping is the application of suction and negative pressure to the skin using heat and sterile glass cups.  Suctioned cups can be stationary on the skin or massaged along areas using massage oil.  The cups help release tight muscles, loosen adhesions, diminish pain and swelling and increase blood flow to tissues.  Cups may be applied for 5-15 minutes and may leave red marks that can last several days.  I will always get consent before performing cupping.</p>
