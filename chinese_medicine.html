			<h1>Chinese Medicine</h1>
			<p>Traditional Chinese Medicine, or TCM, is a therapeutic and preventative medicine developed from more than 2000 years of observation and practice.  Based on the notion of, or energy flow throughout channels of the body, acupuncture and Chinese herbs form an elegant combination that guides the body to heal itself.  The principles of TCM are based upon holistic health, meaning that the entire constitution is taken into account and customized treatment plans are created each visit.  Nutrition and lifestyle play a considerable role.</p>
			<h2>Acupuncture</h2>
			<p>Acupuncture is the insertion of tiny, hair-like filiform needles into specific points throughout the body.  These points lie on meridians that traverse the whole body and connect with the organs.  The inserted needles work to smooth the flow of, or vital energy, and restore balance within the body.  There are over 300 acupuncture points, each possessing specific functions and indications.  There are many different <a href="http://www.webmd.com/pain-management/features/acupuncture-pain-killer">ways in which acupuncture works</a>, including the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>stimulates the release of pain-relieving endorphins</li>
				<li>improves circulation, thus dispersing areas of stagnation, benefiting the skin, improving overall energy, etc.</li> 
				<li>influences the electrical currents within the body</li>
				<li>affects nerve fibers to decrease pain sensation</li>
				<li>mediates inflammation</li>
				<li>harmonizes or re-aligns endocrine system</li>
				<li>stimulates immune system functioning</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Herbal Medicine</h2>
			<p>Chinese herbals are a core component of traditional Chinese Medicine, making it one of the most holistic forms of medicine in the world.  The growing demand in the western world for more natural alternatives to health care has allowed herbal medicine to evolve over the past several thousand years.  In general, customized formulas are created for patients to take daily in pill form or in the form of a cooked decoction.  The formulas safely and effectively treat conditions by re-establishing balance within the body.</p>
