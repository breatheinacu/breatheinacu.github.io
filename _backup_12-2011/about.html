			<h1>WELCOME</h1>
			<p>Inhale exhale repeat.  Breathing deeply and fully is the easiest way to dissolve tension and restore tranquility in the body.  Breathing deeply bathes the cells in oxygen and disperses stagnation in the body.  It refocuses the mind and has a calming effect on the nervous system.  We must take good care of ourselves to be in good health.</p>
			<h2>WHO AM I</h2>
			<p>Lexi Hagenson is a licensed acupuncturist and board certified herbalist.  She graduated from Pacific College of Oriental Medicine in New York City with a masters in Traditional Oriental Medicine.  The rigorous four year program at Pacific included various acupuncture styles and techniques, Oriental medicine theory, Chinese herbology, anatomy, physiology, pathophysiology and nutrition.  Lexi is certified by the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (NCCAOM).  She also holds a bachelors degree in psychology from the University of Wisconsin- Madison.
